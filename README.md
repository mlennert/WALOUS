# WALOUS
Repository with code from the WALOUS research project financed by the Walloon region

These are different scripts meant to be run on an HPC system (*.pbs batch command configuration files are provided as examples). The code is still somewhat in a rough state and will probably need cleanup and better commenting.

The *_config and *_functions files contain config options, but currently on for the tiles creation script. The others still need to be refactored to separate configuration and functions from the actual scripts.
